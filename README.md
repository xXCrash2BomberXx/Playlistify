## âœ¨ Features
- **Convert a Catalog to a Playlist** â€“ Watch entire `catalogs` in order with auto-play by converting them into a Stremio `series` entry.
- **Playlist Grouping** â€“ Put each unique `series` into a different group for easy navigation between the many you generate.
- **Removable Data After** â€“ If you, for some reason, don't want the addons that you "playlistify" still in Stremio after you configure them within this addon, you can simply unisntall them.
